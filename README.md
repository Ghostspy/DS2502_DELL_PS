The base for this project came from https://github.com/garyStofer/DS2502_DELL_PS.  This was a great start, but I discovered that the DS2502 has been replaced by the DS2502+ and as such there are some minor changes to the code and the programming PCB components.

I have created a second Sketch for the code to program the DS2502+ IC.  As for the component changes simply replace the 4.7K resistor (R1) with a 2.2K resistor.
